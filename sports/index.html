      <h4>BasketBall</h4>
      <p>Basketball is a team sport where two teams, usually consisting of five players on each team, play against each other on a rectangular court. The objective is to get the ball through a hoop mounted high on a backboard on the opponent's side of the court, while preventing the opponent from shooting it into your team's hoop. It is a very popular sport worldwide, played with a round and usually orange(orange-brown) ball that bounces. Basketball players mainly use skills such as dribbling, shooting, running, and jumping.</p>

It is played with a big circular ball which is kicked by the players with the aim to hit the goal. It takes a lot of energy and enthusiasm to win the game.</p>

One team hits the ball over the net and into the other team's court, the other team must then hit the ball back over the net and in bounds within three tries without letting the ball touch the ground.There are two main kinds of competitive volleyball played in the world right now. They are team volleyball and beach volleyball. Both are Olympic sports and have competitive leagues. Team volleyball is played indoors on a hard court with 6 people per team. Beach volleyball is played outdoors on the sand with 2 players per team. The rules, strategy, and discussion here will focus on team volleyball.</p>
